## it if you know what you're doing.

## The app port is only relevant for using Mattermost without the nginx container as reverse proxy. This is not meant
## to be used with the internal HTTP server exposed but rather in case one wants to host several services on one host
## or for using it behind another existing reverse proxy.

## Configuration settings for Mattermost. Documentation on the variables and the settings itself can be found at
## https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html
## Keep in mind that variables set here will take precedence over the same setting in config.json. This includes
## the system console as well and settings set with env variables will be greyed out.
